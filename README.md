# Fundamentals Of Javascript with NodeJS, ExpressJS and some basics of Socket.io
Basic Javascript Fundamental Codes

- We learn about basics of Javascript for Frontend and Backend with **NodeJS** and **ExpressJS**

- We create a **Chat-App** with **Socket.io** following the tutorial by [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD7FnbI76Hg)

- In depth README.md files are added with each folder prepared by me to comprehend how to manipulate certain modules and code, do give them a go whenever code isnt clear


Thanks, Maheswaran
